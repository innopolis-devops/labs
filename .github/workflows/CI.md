# Best practices with Continuous Integration with Github Actions
1. Commit early, commit often. Committing regularly ensures your team works on the same foundations, thereby facilitating collaboration, 
and reduces the likelihood of painful merge conflicts when integrating large, complex changes
2. Donâ€™t install dependencies unnecessarily
3. Limit environment variables to the narrowest possible scope
4. Run the tests that complete quickest first in order to get feedback as early as possible, and only invest in lengthier tests once you have 
a degree of confidence in the build
