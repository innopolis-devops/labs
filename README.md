# Flask app python

Flask is a lightweight Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) web application framework.
I use Flask because:
>   1) The Flask framework is easy to understand, that is why it is best for beginners. (And I am a beginner in usage of frameworks)
> 2) It is very flexible and easy.
>  3) Testing 

BTW, Flask has disadvantages: 
> 1) Scale: if you are trying to serve multiple requests, it will take more time.
> 2) Modules: some issues on security

### About app:
This is a simple app showing current time in Moscow (UTC+3) without any extra features. Just time.

### How to run:
1) Hope you have already installed Python and some IDE (in my case it was PyCharm), installed Flask and venv
2) Copy the folder "app_python" and run "main.py" file in IDE
3) Above there will be a link (containing 127.0.0.1:8080), click on it
4) Enjoy!
