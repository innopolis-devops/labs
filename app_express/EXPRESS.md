# Express js best practices

## Framework

Why to use Express?

In addition to being one of the most popular Node frameworks, Express also offers simplicity, efficiency, and minimalism without the baggage or opinions. That is why it's one of the best options for our task.

## Writing Well-Structured Python Code

Especially while making projects, you must include a README file for describing your project, a clean `package.json` file with as few  `dependencies` as possible and some helpful script entries, and `devdependencies` for the development dependencies.

## Linters

ESLint is used for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions: ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
