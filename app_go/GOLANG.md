# Best practices - Golang version

## Technology Stack

I used **net/http** as library for web server as:

- It's from the bof without any installation
- Yet it is powerful enough to create good web applications
- No need to use any WSGI/ASGi as in python

## Linters

Golang has enabled a lot of linters by default.[Check this link to see all enabled linters](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/linters/)

For Markdow I decided to use markdownlint as an extension in VSCode
