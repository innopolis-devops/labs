# CI best practices
- ### Commit early, commit often
    Ensuring all your source code, configuration files, scripts, libraries and executables are in source control is an essential first step towards implementing continuous integration, enabling you to keep track of every change
- ### Optimize pipeline stages
    CI pipelines contain jobs and stages: Jobs are the activities that happen within a particular stage, and once all jobs pass, code moves to the next stage. To get the most out of your CI pipelines, optimize stages so that failures are easy to identify and fix.
- ### Make builds fast and simple
    Nothing slows down a pipeline like complexity. Focus on keeping builds fast, and the best way to do that is by keeping things as simple as possible.
- ###  Fix the Broken Builds
    Ensure that your build and test process is available and visible to your development teams.
