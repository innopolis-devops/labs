# Framework

I use flask for doing Lab 1.

## About flask

Flask is a minimalist framework, it provides only the necessary tools, but it extends its functionality with additional libraries and frameworks. 

## Pros and cons

Pros:
- Quickly and simply
- Flexibility

Cons:

- Not a lot of tools (but enough to finish lab)
- Maintenance costs

## Linters
I use Pycharm embedded linter for Python.
Also, I use Stackedit.io for Markdown.


# Unit tests 
## Description
-   First test checks main entrypoint return something (not  `None`)
-   Second test checks main entrypoint return type is string
-   Third test checks main entrypoint contain word  `"center"`  in the response


## Best practices
-   Small tests 
-   Organize files and folders properly
-   Use proper namings for files and functions
-   Test each small piece of software independently
