## Best practices
- Using virtual environment
- Followed PEP8 styleguide
- Followed official naming conventions
- Documented the code

I would have used more if only the codebase were bigger. But I read about more practices related to code.

## Why Flask
Flask is super lightweight framework which allows me to quickly finish this lab task.\
It is certainly a production-ready framework, and it is a good choice to start with because of its simplicity.

Pros:
- Flexibility - you can customize different parts because framework does not bring infinite dependencies for your app
- Simplicity - framework is designed to be applied really quickly

Cons:
- Maintenance - framework does not include all features which requires developer to bring them. Maintaining these dozens
of external dependencies comes at a cost

## Linters
For Python, I used Pylint which suggested adding docstrings.\
For Markdown, I used [Markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint).

## Template
Used subset of [this](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/blob/master/README.md) 
template for `README.md`
