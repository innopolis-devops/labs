I don't have a lot of exporoane in python developent and don't whant to.

## Framework

In this app I used Flusk since it is one of the most simple and popular frameworks out here.

## Practices

As there is almpst nothing to do there are only a few practices I could addopt

### 1. Use Lint

Here I used flake8 since it is first lint I could find

### 2. Tests

- use tests for each unit
- don't compare time directly but through delta

## Conclusion
