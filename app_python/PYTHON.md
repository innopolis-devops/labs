- Use venv (virtual environment)
- Write requirements.txt file with information about installed libs
- Use linters

# Framework Flask

I chose Flash because it has a small entry threshold

## Pros

- Easy to start
- Flask is light and flexible
- Small core and easily extensible

## Cons

- Less powerful than other frameworks (e.g. Django)
- Not async-friendly
- Lack of database
