# Python

## Flask
I used flask because it is simple framework with HTML code support

###Advantages:
1) Scalable
2) Simpler Development
3) Flexibility
4) Performance
5) Modularity

###Disadvantages:
1) Not standardized
2) Bad developers will write worse code
3) Fewer tools
4) Community
5) Single source of truth

## Best Practices
1) Gunicorn as Python WSGI server
2) Ninja2 as template language
3) Flake8 as linter
