## Best practices for Python apps

1. Install packages with `requirements.txt`
2. Virtual environment for a project.
3. Exclude irrelevant files from git with `.gitignore`
4. Linter `pylint` for fixing syntactic bugs (configs are in *.pylintrc*).
5. License file to protect the code distribution.
6. Use templates for web pages using HTML.
