## framework I used

Flask is a lightweight Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) web application framework.
I use Flask because:
>   1) The Flask framework is easy to understand, that is why it is best for beginners. (And I am a beginner in usage of frameworks)
> 2) It is very flexible and easy.
>  3) Testing 

BTW, Flask has disadvantages: 
> 1) Scale: if you are trying to serve multiple requests, it will take more time.
> 2) Modules: some issues on security

## best practices

> 1) use virtual environment
> 2) avoid single-letter variable names
> 3) use requirements.txt to list all necessary requirements
> 4) implement version control, create code repository

## unit testing

> 1) small tests
> 2) use proper namings for files and functions
> 3) organize files and folders properly
> 4) test each small piece of software independently
