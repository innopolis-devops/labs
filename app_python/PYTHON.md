# General

1. Use `.gitignore` file to keep avoid unnecessary files from being version-controlled
2. Use linters and prettyfiers to avoid mistakes during development and help keep code consistent (usually comes with IDEs/easily installable)

# Framework
While advantages are best described by the [docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/), the main reasons for choosing FastApi were

1. It is production-ready
2. Ease of use, low entry threshold (e.g. compared to Django)
3. Still has lots of features out of the box:
    1. Testing tools
    2. Templates
