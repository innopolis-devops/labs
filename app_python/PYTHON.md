# Framework

I use flask for doing Lab 1.

## About flask

Flask is a minimalist framework, it provides only the necessary tools, but it extends its functionality with additional libraries and frameworks. 

## Pros and cons

Pros:
- Quickly and simply
- Flexibility

Cons:

- Not a lot of tools (but enough to finish lab)
- Maintenance costs

## Linters
I use Pycharm embedded linter for Python.
Also, I use Stackedit.io for Markdown.
