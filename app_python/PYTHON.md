# About Python application 

1. Use [Flask Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
2. Use [Flake8 linter](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

## Flask Framework
Flask is one of the most popular web frameworks for Python. 
And the reason why I choose Flask Framework rather than others is in ease of use and flexibility.
You just need install it and add some line of codes to run application. 
Other pros of Flask is scalable, lightweight and good Documentation. 
What about cons of Flask, it is microframework, so it do not have a lot of tools and not designed for big projects.

## Flake8
I use flake8, because it is fast to install and use. Just one command to show all style errors.

## Unit tests
1. Add unit test that get from web application time, and check it with datetime library that it is same as moscow time.
2. Not used to many tests in one module
3. Test does not take too much time to execute
