# Implementation details

## Python

### Python formatting

Using [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) PEP 8 compliant formatter. Might be configured as a pre-commit hook, but didn't do that, just ran `black .` before committing.

### Framework choice

The app is written in [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), which is as lightweight as a commonly used Flask, but uses ASGI and offers more advanced features out of the box. Most importantly, it uses type hints a lot, which greatly reduces the amount of errors in the code.

I also like its thorough [documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) a lot.

### Testing

I'm using [`pytest`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/) for testing, it is quite simple yet powerful framework for testing.

All the tests (there are a few) are stored in the [`tests`](./tests) folder. They cover a separate time-providing component, as well as the app as a whole (without reaching out to the global network).

The best practices applied, namely:

- Tests are written detailedly, so are easy to understand
- They run quite fast â€” it won't take much time to test the app
- Tests don't depend on any external services, so can be run repeatedly as much as it needed

## Markdown

### Markdown linting

Using [`vscode-markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) in VS Code with format-on-save feature. Great thing!
