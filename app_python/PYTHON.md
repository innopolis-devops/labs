# Python

## Flask

```
I used flask because it is simple framework with HTML code support
```

### Advantages

```
1) Scalable
2) Simpler Development
3) Flexibility
4) Performance
5) Modularity
```

### Disadvantages

```
1) Not standardized
2) Bad developers will write worse code
3) Fewer tools
4) Community
5) Single source of truth
```

## Best Practices

```
1) Gunicorn as Python WSGI server
2) Ninja2 as template language
3) Flake8 as linter for python
4) .gitignore for git

Also, I used [this linter](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) for markdown
```

## Unit tests

```
Tests: 
1) Check response codes correctness
2) Check time in template correctness (using time freezing)

Best practives:
1) Tests are clear (Readable, etc)
2) Full coverage
3) Unchangeble result after several starts
4) Adding to GitHub Actions
