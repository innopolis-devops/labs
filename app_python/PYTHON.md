# Current Time in Moscow

## Overview
This is a simple Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow. It uses the Flask web framework and the datetime module to get the current time in the Europe/Moscow timezone. The time is displayed in a user-friendly format on a web page.

## Build
To build this application, you need to create a Python file with a main.py extension, for example, app.py. Then, copy the code in main.py to your file. Save the file and run it using the command python app.py in a terminal or command prompt. 
The application will start running on your local machine.

## Usage
To use the application, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/. The current time in Moscow will be displayed on the web page. The time will be updated every time you refresh the page.

## Contact
If you have any questions or feedback about this application, please contact the developer at [insert contact information here].

## Production Ready

I have already chosen Flask as your framework. Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework that is well-suited for small to medium-sized web applications. It has a simple and intuitive API, and it's easy to get started with. However, Flask may not be as powerful as some of the other frameworks, and it may not be the best choice for large-scale applications.

3. Update the PYTHON.md file and describe all best practices that you applied, then explain why you chose your framework and its pros and cons:
In the PYTHON.md file, you should describe all the best practices that you applied to your application, such as using a virtual environment, separating your code into modules, and using version control. You should also explain why you chose your framework and its pros and cons. For example, if you chose Flask, you might explain that it's lightweight and easy to use, but it may not be as powerful as some of the other frameworks.

4. Use linters for Python and Markdown:
Linters are tools that help you identify and fix errors in your code. For Python, you can use a tool like Flake8 or PyLint. For Markdown, you can use a tool like markdownlint. In the PYTHON.md file, you should describe which linters you used and how they helped you improve your code.

5. Research and use a good template for the README.md file:
A good README.md file should provide an overview of your application, instructions for building and running it, and contact information for the developer. You can find many good templates for README.md files online, such as the one provided in the PRECEDING_CODE section. In the README.md file, you should follow the template and provide all the necessary information about your application.
