# DevOps Lab #1
Simple python web app that allows to get current time.

# Overview.
1. Build it via
```shell
make build-dev
```

2. Run it via
```shell
make local
```

3. Go to `http://localhost/docs`. Use `admin` as login and password.

# Makefile commands

1. You can edit values in the variable section in the Makefile:
```shell
###--VARIABLES--########################################################################################################

AWS_ACCOUNT=553667903818
AWS_REPOSITORIES_REGION=eu-north-1

SERVICE_NAME=app_python
CONTAINERS=api watchtower

########################################################################################################################
```

Variable `AWS_ACCOUNT` should be changed only if we are migrating to the new AWS account. Variable 
`AWS_REPOSITORIES_REGION` indicates region of `ECR` repositories for containers. You should modify `SERVICE_NAME`
according to the name of the service you are developing right now. And the `CONTAINERS` variables stores all containers
if the format `container-1 container-2 container-3`.

2. At the very first time you need to initialize (create) `ECR` repositories. To that run following commands:
```shell
make ecr_init
```

This will create repositories for all your containers with names like `SERVICE_NAME/CONTAINER_NAME`.

3. You can use linters to check your code quality:
```shell
make lint
```

4. To reformat code according to linters style, simply run:
```shell
make refactor
```

5. To build, push and pull containers use `make` with `build-STAGE`/`push-STAGE`/`pull-STAGE` commands. You may need to login into
aws ecr via `make ecr_login`. There are two stages - `dev` and `prod`:
```shell
make ecr_login
make pull-dev
make build-dev
make push-dev
```

6. You can clean docker cache and volumes with help of the following commands respectively:
```shell
make prune
make prune-v
```

7. To start the service locally use `make STAGE-local`. This will download credentials and start service locally. You
can change environment variables in `.env.priority`. To be able to specify namespace for environment variables use
NAMESPACE argument.
```shell
make dev-local
NAMESPACE=opensea make dev-local
```

You can also start service without downloading variables from AWS. Just use `make local`. This will use `dev` as tag.

8. In order to start service in the server use `make STAGE`. There are two stages - `dev` and `prod` To be able to 
specify namespace for environment variables use NAMESPACE argument:
```shell
make dev
NAMESPACE=innopolis make dev
```

9. You can stop or down your services with `make` and `stop`/`down`/`down-v`. The `down-v` command will also delete all
volumes of the service.
```shell
make stop
make down-v
```

10. You can download environment variables via `TAG=STAGE make env`. There are two stages - `dev` and `prod` To be able 
to specify namespace for environment variables use NAMESPACE argument.
```shell
TAG=dev make env
TAG=dev NAMESPACE=innopolis make env
```
