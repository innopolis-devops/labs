# Swift application

## Best practices

1. Install dependencies using `Package.swift`.
2. Exclude irrelevant files from git with `.gitignore`
3. Linter `swiftlint` for fixing syntactic bugs (configs are in *.swiftlint.yml*).
4. License file to protect the code distribution.
5. Use templates for web pages using Leaf.

## Framework used

It was decided to use the *Vaport* framework for the development.
It allows to build a light web applications from scratch in a fast way.
The framework is written in Swift too. Vapor is also asynchronous, type-safe and intuitive for new developers.
