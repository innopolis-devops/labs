## Helm secrets

I have run into GPG error when trying to set up secrets, and was not able to find a soution to it:

```
helm secrets install app-python ./app-python -n default -f ./secrets.yaml 

Failed to get the data key required to decrypt the SOPS file.

Group 0: FAILED
  F54C01BD1C065D74AF57E11AA3102743D20415B8: FAILED
    - | could not decrypt data key with PGP key:

      | file or directory; GPG binary error: exit status 2

Recovery failed because no master key was able to decrypt the file. In
order for SOPS to recover the file, at least one key has to be successful,
but none were.
