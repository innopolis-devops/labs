## Bonus

1. StatefulSet associates a persistent storage data with pod. It's like  _Deployment_ with storage. We need them in order to add some persistent storage in our application.
2. PersistentVolumes - storage objects that do not depend on the lifetime of the pods that use them. Need them to storage some static data or maybe shared data.
3. Services without proxy that will redirect request to the right pod. for example client may want to connect to all of those pods. We may want to just disable load balancing for some reason
