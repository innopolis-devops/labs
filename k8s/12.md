# ConfigMap

After setting up all the configurations and running the application, I execute the following commands to check if the file is successfully mounted inside:

```plain
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
helm-python-5f54dbccfb-lgzrd   1/1     Running   3 (42s ago)   3m15s

$ kubectl exec helm-python-5f54dbccfb-lgzrd -- cat /config.json

{
    "authorName": "Igor Belov",
    "authorEmail": "i.belov@innopolis.university"
}
```

As we can see, everything works fine.
