# ConfigMaps in Helm

ConfigMap allows to transfer the files data to containers, for example to pass some not big files and not to include them in the image (configuration files).

Inside configmap.yaml I've sending the content of app_config.json file to save this into the file.
After this I've mounted data for containers using `volumeMounts` and `volumes` in deployment.yaml.

### Result:
```sh
# Get created pods
$ kubectl get po
NAME                           READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE

# View files in /app folder, config.json file should be here
$ kubectl exec baka-07790fb03d-13543 -- ls -l /home/app

# File is in place, let's read it
$ kubectl exec msc-time-py-54f755498c-13h43 -- cat config.json
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "history_text": "Records of time"
}
```
Oh man, I've done it :cry:
So tired of this lab tbh...


## Bonus: StatefulSet, Headless service, Persistent Volumes
StatefulSet allows to manage pods. It is kinda similar to Deployment, but unlike Deployment it can manage unique names for pods and persistent volumes on different nodes.

Headless service is  used to create DNS records for pods, so we can access them by name.

PersistentValumes is a storage that is available for all pods, so we can store common files.
