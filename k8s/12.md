### Terminology
* __StatefulSet__: API for managing pods in stateful manner. It is like a Deployment, but it guarantees uniqueness of the pods.
* __Headless service__: mechanism to manage request without load balancing, service ip. It sends requests directly to pods.
* __Persistent Volumes__: piece of storage which does not depend on lifetime of pods.
