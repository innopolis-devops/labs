## Reasoning behind the different output

Since our replicas rely on different persistent volumes, they do their I/O into their respective volumes, without intersecting between each other, writing visits into only their own log file.

## Why app ordering is unnecessary in our case?

Our app is running the same functions accross all replicas, and they are independent of each other. If, for example, we have had a global state that changes depending on function calls accross all replicas, we would need to implement ordering to ensure that we will get a determined and predictable result after each function call from any of the replicas.
