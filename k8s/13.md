3. The differences: 

- The logs count is not the same, it is more in fist file. Probably this is because load balancer differently manages resources. 
- I store time in lods, we can see that time also different. I think the reason is the same  - load balanced not equally distribute the load. 

4. The ordering is unnecessary because each replicas are independent from each others, i.e, it will work even if other replicas fall or even if they do not exist.

We can start the pods in parallel by adding podManagementPolicy: "Parallel" to statfulset.yaml file.
