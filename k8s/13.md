The replicas have different output because each pod has it own value and LoadBalancer distibutes requests not equally.

For our app ordering is unnesessary because replicas are independent from each other. To make pods start and terminate in parallel, added  `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"` to spec

 ## Bonus

There are two update strategies in Kuberbetes. Update strategies in Stateful set are used to control or disable updates for containers, labels, resource request/limits, and annotations for the Pods.

- OnDelete - user needs to delete pods to update them, no automated updates

- RollingUpdate - automated updates, default strategy
