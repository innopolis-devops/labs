## `deployment` -> `stateful`

1. change `kind: StatefulSet` to `kind: StatefulSet` in deployment.yaml
2. change name `deployment.yaml` to `statefulset.yaml`
3. `helm install --dry-run --debug pink-time pink-time/` worked pretty well
4. `kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc`
```shell
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/pink-time-0        1/1     Running   0          4h13m
pod/pink-time-1        1/1     Running   0          4h13m
pod/pink-time-2        1/1     Running   0          4h13m

NAME                              READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/pink-time        3/3     4h13m

NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
service/kubernetes       ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          5h15m
service/pink-time        NodePort    10.111.180.223   <none>        5000:30144/TCP   4h13m
```

### now try to access with different params
`> pod/pink-time-0`
```shell
03:51:36 - 192.168.1.106
03:51:39 - 192.168.1.106
03:51:44 - 192.168.1.106
03:51:48 - 192.168.1.106
03:51:58 - 192.168.1.106
03:52:07 - 192.168.1.106
03:52:14 - 192.168.1.106
03:52:17 - 192.168.1.106
```
`> pod/pink-time-1`
```shell
03:51:59 - 192.168.1.106
03:52:06 - 192.168.1.106
03:52:13 - 192.168.1.106
03:52:18 - 192.168.1.106
```

`> pod/pink-time-2`
```shell
03:52:07 - 192.168.1.106
03:52:10 - 192.168.1.106
03:52:17 - 192.168.1.106
```
### why different numbers in requests?..
each pod has a local `visits` file, and, moreover not the same pod might answer to user request due to k8s smert scheduling

### implementing in parallel
1. h2o - just add the line below to freshly renamed `statefulset.yaml`  to `spec.podManagementPolicy` path
```yaml
podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"
```
2. enjoy amazing results:
```shell
> kubectl get po
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/pink-time-0     1/1     Running   0          10s
pod/pink-time-1     1/1     Running   0          10s
pod/pink-time-2     1/1     Running   0          10s
```

### why we don't want ordering?
_...though k8s guaranteed them..._

we have smol lil pink time app right here and my poor laptop which i have to freeze manually when i launch the server, no ordering is needed
