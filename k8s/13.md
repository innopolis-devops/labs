# StatefulSet

## 10 points

### Starting and checking /visists

> NOTE: I changed healthcheak from `/` to `/health` in `statefulset.yaml` because access `/` creates entry in `visits.json`

After helm install:

Access `http://127.0.0.1:61410/` several times and then go to `/visists`:

Check content of the files:

Every pod has it's own version of `visits.json`, so when I access `http://127.0.0.1:61410/` choses "random" pod and redirect my request to this pod, so, visits content is different. Also, by refreshing `/visits` several times one can also find different content. 



### Ordering

Ordering is not needed because our app is independent from replicas


### Launch in parallel

We can make StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel by adding

```
podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"
```

in `statefulset.yaml`

### Update strategy

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#update-strategies

`.spec.updateStrategy` field is used to configure updates. there are possible values:

+ [**Rolling updates**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/) incrementally replace your resource's Pods with new ones, which are then scheduled on nodes with available resources. Rolling updates are designed to update your workloads **without downtime**.

+ **On Delete** remove auto updating and forces user manually delete Pods to cause the controller to create new Pods.
