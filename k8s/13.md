#### WARNING

unfortunately, something's wrong with my minikube (maybe needed bridge is absent), so i cannot make any outputs of `kubectl exec pod/demo-0 -- cat visits` command.

#### BUT!!! p.3.6 answer

each statefulset pode stores its pwn state. there are 3 persistent storage in total. while executing a request, BalanceLoader redirects a request to random node. that's why the differences occur

#### p.4 answer

each instance of an app is independent from each other, so we just don't care which node the request is sent to.

also, according to tutorial, here's how we can manage pods in parallel
