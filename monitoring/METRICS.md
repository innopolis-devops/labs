## Prometheus config

Idk honestly I just took things from [loki production example](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/production/docker/docker-compose.yaml) and tuned them to fit the existing structure.

I don't have 3 types of Loki containers and a gateway for them, so I just changed Prometheus config to scrape metrics from the only Loki container I have, plus the Prometheus container itself.

I've also added some persistency to Prometheus and Grafana by adding volumes in the docker-compose file and attaching them to the container.

## Results

### Sample query

Query: `loki_log_messages_total`

## Dashboards

Installed the ones suggested in the lab task:

- Loki: <https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13407>
- Prometheus: <https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/3662>

I've also added Grafana provisionong config to add these dashboards automatically at startup.

## docker-compose improvements

- Added log rotation via options for the default JSON logger:

```yaml
max-size: 10m
max-file": 3
```

- Added memory limits for all the containers via `mem_limit` for each service.
  - Fun fact: `mem_limit` is said to be [not available in Compose V3](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#resources), but it still seems to be working as of version 3.9:

  ```

- Added `python_app` and `ts_app` containers to `loki` network to enable metrics collection.

- Added [**healthchecks**](#healthcheck-in-docker-compose) using either `wget` or `redis-cli`

## Metrics collection in apps

For the Python app, I used [Prometheus FastAPI Instrumentator](https://github.com/trallnag/prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator) to collect metrics.

For Typescript (Express.js), [Express Prometheus bundle](https://github.com/jochen-schweizer/express-prom-bundle) is used.

Both instruments provide basic metrics about requests, including paths, response times, and status codes.

### Graph of request count

Filtering by app type and route (`/`)

Query: `http_requests_total{handler="/",job="python_app"} or http_request_duration_seconds_count{path="/",job="ts_app"}`

## Healthcheck in Docker Compose

### Implementation

Most containers have HTTP servers with a `/ready`, `/health` or, for my apps in Python and TypeScript, `/status`, so it makes sense to check health using these routes â€” which I did, mostly using `wget`.

Redis containers are checked using `redis-cli ping` command.

#### Promtail healthcheck with Bash

Unlike all others, Promtail container does not have `wget`, `curl` and even `nc`, but it has Bash, which [can do TCP stuff](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/more-using-bashs-built-devtcp-file-tcpip).

I honestly admit that I took [the solution](https://github.com/innopolis-devops/labs/blob/c556e3520e813fb1b128b2346bf8f713b64ce7a8/monitoring/docker-compose.yml#L62) from @bragov4ik, but I have improved it in such a way that it displays the response body which contains a detailed message in case the container is not ready.

Here's is a brief explanation of the healthcheck command:

```bash
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/localhost/9080 && \        # Connect to tcp://localhost:9080 (Promtail HTTP)
echo -e 'GET /ready HTTP/1.0\n\n' >&3 && \  # Make a HTTP 1.0 request to /ready route
awk 'f;/^\r/{f=1}; $0 ~ /HTTP\/1.0 200/ {s=1}; END {exit !s}' <&3 || exit 1 # Parse the response using awk :ohh_yeah:
```

The `awk` program does 3 things:

1. Print all the lines after an empty line (that is, after all response headers)
2. If any of the lines (with headers) contains `HTTP/1.0 200`, set the success flag to 1
3. In the end, exit with 0 only if `HTTP/1.0 200` was found, 1 otherwise.

Why HTTP 1.0? Simply because it won't require adding `Host` and `Connection: close` headers.

### Ensuring the system health

```sh
docker ps
```
