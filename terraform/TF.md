#### `terraform state list` output

```terraform
docker_container.python_app
docker_image.python_app
```

### Changes

The changes applied were:

- the container being renamed (not seen in `terraform plan` since the default value matched the one used previously)
- external port changed from `8000` to `8080`
- added outputs (see [`outputs.tf`](./docker/outputs.tf))

## Yandex Cloud

Followed the tutorial from Yandex Cloud Docs, available here:
<https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart>.

It goes through creating two virtual machines and a network between them.

### Setup

Refer to the [`yandex_cloud`](./yandex_cloud) folder for the source files.

Outputs have been also created at the initial setup.

#### `terraform show`

At this point I was able to try out SSH connections between the VMs.

#### `terraform state list`

```terraform
yandex_compute_instance.vm-1
yandex_compute_instance.vm-2
yandex_vpc_network.network-1
yandex_vpc_subnet.subnet-1
```

### Changes to the plan

The changes applied were:

- Change RAM and CPU count for the second VM (to 2 GB and 2 vCPU instead of 4 and 4)

#### `terraform plan` output

##### First attempt

<details>
<summary>Click to show...</summary>

```terraform
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # yandex_compute_instance.vm-2 will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "yandex_compute_instance" "vm-2" {
        id                        = "epd8mek89vp90odvt48c"
        name                      = "terraform2"
        # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)

      ~ resources {
          ~ cores         = 4 -> 2
          ~ memory        = 4 -> 2
            # (2 unchanged attributes hidden)
        }

        # (4 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

</details>

##### The problem

But after running `terraform apply`, here appears an error:

```text
Error: Changing the resources, platform_id, network_acceleration_type, scheduling_policy, placement_policy in an instance requires stopping it. To acknowledge this action, please set allow_stopping_for_update = true in your config file.
```

##### The new version

<details>
<summary>Click to show...</summary>

```terraform
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # yandex_compute_instance.vm-2 will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "yandex_compute_instance" "vm-2" {
      + allow_stopping_for_update = true
        id                        = "epd8mek89vp90odvt48c"
        name                      = "terraform2"
        # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)

      ~ resources {
          ~ cores         = 4 -> 2
          ~ memory        = 4 -> 2
            # (2 unchanged attributes hidden)
        }

        # (4 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  - external_ip_address_vm_2 = "84.201.162.213" -> null
```

</details>

#### `terraform output`

##### First attempt (yes)

```terraform
external_ip_address_vm_1 = "51.250.27.108"
external_ip_address_vm_2 = ""
internal_ip_address_vm_1 = "192.168.10.20"
internal_ip_address_vm_2 = "192.168.10.16"
```

##### Another problem

For some reason, the second VM now does not have an IP address... or does it? While trying to run `terraform destroy`, I noticed that IP is written there:

```terraform
Changes to Outputs:
  - external_ip_address_vm_1 = "51.250.27.108" -> null
  - external_ip_address_vm_2 = "84.201.137.155" -> null
  - internal_ip_address_vm_1 = "192.168.10.20" -> null
  - internal_ip_address_vm_2 = "192.168.10.16" -> null
```

But it was still unavailable in `terraform output`.

I googled a bit and found out that there is a way to *refresh* the outputs:

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only
```

After that, `terraform output` worked as it should had done originally:

##### Final result

```terraform
external_ip_address_vm_1 = "51.250.27.108"
external_ip_address_vm_2 = "84.201.137.155"
internal_ip_address_vm_1 = "192.168.10.20"
internal_ip_address_vm_2 = "192.168.10.16"
```

## Github repository

### Importing the repo

In the [`./github`](./github/) folder, running:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<TOKEN>"
terraform init
terraform import "github_repository.repo" "iu-devops-labs"
```

After the successful import, `terraform show` shows the `github_repository.repo` resource with all the params.

### Applying changes

The changes added were:

- default `master` branch
- protection rules on the `master` branch
  - no force pushes
  - no branch deletion
  - conversation resolutions are required
- (unintentional) disable downloads, projects and issues
  - decided not to keep them since we're not using them anyway

## Best practices used

- Variables and outputs:
  - are declared separately
  - have a descriptive name and description
  - variables also have types defined
- External files (e.g. user configs for Yandex Cloud setup) are moved into a separate directories
- Built-in formatting is used (`terraform fmt`)
- dependency lock (`.terraform.lock.hcl`) is uploaded together with other files to track the changes of dependencies
- secrets are not commited, stored as env variables instead
