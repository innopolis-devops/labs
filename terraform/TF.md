# Terraform
## With Docker
I followed a series of [guides](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/docker-get-started)

### Initial

First output of `terraform apply` command:

```
docker_image.nginx: Refreshing state... [id=sha256:3f8a00f137a0d2c8a2163a09901e28e2471999fde4efc2f9570b91f1c30acf94nginx:latest]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

### Change infrastructure

**I changed port `8000` to `8082`**:

Output of `terraform apply`:

```

}
```
### Add Variables and Outputs
I added name of container as a variable. In order to do so, I had to create `variables.tf` file and change a line in `main.tf`:

```
  name  = var.container_name
```
Name of docker container was changed, too. `docker ps`:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                  NAMES
9bf9569dd7ee   3f8a00f137a0   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   5 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   0.0.0.0:8082->80/tcp   devops-docker-tf
```

** I added outputs - IP address and container id **
`terraform output`:
```
container_id = "9bf9569dd7eebb474e43cb8f5f94e14856f691af25111f8c9ae2a74f20ae515a"
ip_address = "172.17.0.2"
```

## With cloud

I used Yandex cloud form this [guide](https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart)

I used Ubuntu 18.04 LTS image from Yandex Marketplace with id: `fd8irfoscugmpsoanefh`

### Changes
I manually changed name of the service which led to:

```
yandex_vpc_network.network-1: Refreshing state... [id=enpli1aaifsckp4j3u4o]
yandex_vpc_subnet.subnet-1: Refreshing state... [id=e9b904eljqnc5cma4amu]
yandex_compute_instance.vm-1: Refreshing state... [id=fhmm98cicod8c5gablg5]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # yandex_compute_instance.vm-1 will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "yandex_compute_instance" "vm-1" {
        id                        = "fhmm98cicod8c5gablg5"
      ~ name                      = "terraform1" -> "changedname"
        # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)

        # (6 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

### Variables and output

Since I couldn't easily chenge something meaningful for the computer (like number of cores or memory), I changed name and zone using variables.

I also printed in output external and internal IPs (to connect with SSH) which printed the following:

```
external_ip_address_vm_1 = "51.250.15.138"
internal_ip_address_vm_1 = "192.168.10.19"
```
Then connected to VM using `ssh ubuntu@51.250.15.138`:
