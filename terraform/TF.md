## Cloud

I decided to use Yandex Cloud.

So, I will follow [this](https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart#configure-terraform) guide.

### Initial

I created 1 resource `vm` - ubuntu machine, exposed ip of it from output.tf and connected to it using ssh.

#### output of `tf apply`

Outputs:

```

after that I can connect to vm using ssh:

### Change numer of cores 2 -> 4, memory 2 -> 4

```sh
tf destroy

          + cores         = 4

### Change instance name using input vars

```

## Best practices

+ use [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Terraform.gitignore) file
+ add token to gitignore!
+ split into folders and files. move output and var into separate files.
+ use `tf fmt` to format your files
+ Use `vars.tf` for such vars like instance names, zone name, etc
+ `tf destroy` at the end. no wasting resources.
+ upload lock files to git repo to support same dependencies
