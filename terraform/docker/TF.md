After changing container name in `variables.tf` from `ExampleNginxContainer`
 to `NginxDockerExampleContainer` and applying changes we can see new name
 when running `terraform output`:

 ```bash
 container_id = "14b2b8384ca1c780e7d6509f9dc3d00ba7468cbb2954a4e8ae85aff38587e4fc"
container_name = "NginxDockerExampleContainer"
image_id = "sha256:2d389e545974d4a93ebdef09b650753a55f72d1ab4518d17a30c0e1b3e297444nginx:latest"
 ```
